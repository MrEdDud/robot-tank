# robot-tank
A project where I am making a small robot tank from a raspberry pi and many other components

Notes for future writing:
- first time using git in an actual project
- ssh stuff
- raspberry pi components
- making code to send links from my pc to raspberry pi
- making code which plays sound
- designing the tank
- manufacturing the baseplate
- used CAD for the first time
- learning about lots of different circuitry 
- using motors, speakers, microphones for first time
- the painful journey of hooking up the motors, switching physical pins and bcm gpio num

Main stuff I used
- Raspberry pi 5
- DC motor 6V
- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
- Microphone SPH0645LM4H
- Adafruit Mono I2S Speaker Bonnet
- Motor driver TB6612FNG

Connecting the motor
